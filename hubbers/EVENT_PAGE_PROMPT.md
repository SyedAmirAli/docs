Design a single-page user interface in React using TailwindCSS with `tw:` prefix for all utility classes.

-   Use Lucide React icons for UI elements (menu, search, notification, settings, etc.)
-   All components must be placed on a single page file.
-   Use Unsplash free images where necessary (e.g., banner, avatar, cards).
-   Primary color should be #8BC53F.
-   Structure the layout for responsiveness.
-   Include the following sections:

1. **Header** – with a logo (use placeholder), nav links, and right-aligned user profile dropdown.
2. **Hero Section** – full-width banner with headline, subheadline, CTA button.
3. **Features Section** – 3 or 4 feature cards with Lucide icons and short descriptions.
4. **Content Section** – some text blocks and image side-by-side.
5. **Gallery/Grid** – a responsive image gallery (pull free images from Unsplash).
6. **Testimonials** – a few user cards with name, photo, and quote.
7. **Footer** – with links and social icons using Lucide.

Use clean and modern design with rounded corners, shadows, and spacing. Don’t create separate files, write all JSX in one page file using React functional components.
